This Series will contain the Latin authors usually read in Ameri-
can schools and colleges, and also others well adapted to class-room
use, but not' as yet published in suitable editions. The several
volumes will be prepared by special editors, who will aim to revise
the text ,carefully and to edit it in the most serviceable manner.
Where there are German editions of unusual merit, representing
years of special study under the most favorable circumstances,
these will be used, with the consent of the foreign editor, as a basis
for the American edition. In this way it will be possible to bring
out text-books of the highest excellence in a comparatively short

’period of time.

The editions will be of two kinds, conforming to the different
methods of studying Latin in our best institutions. Some will
contain in the introductions and commentary such a careful and
minute treatment of the author's life, language‚ and style as to
afford the means for a thorough appreciation of the author and his
place in Latin literature. Others will aim merely to assist the
student to a good reading knowledge of the author, and will have
only the text and brief explanatory notes at the bottom of each
page. The latter will be particularly acceptable for sight reading,
and for rapid reading after the minute study of an author or period
in one of the fuller editions. For instance, after a class has read
a play or two of Plautus and Terence carefully‚ With special refer-
ence to the peculiarities of style, language‚ metres, the methods
of presenting a play, and the like, these editions will be admirably
suited for the rapid reading of other plays.

The Series will also contain various supplementary works pre-
pared by competent scholars. Every effort will be made to give
the books a neat and attractive appearance.
