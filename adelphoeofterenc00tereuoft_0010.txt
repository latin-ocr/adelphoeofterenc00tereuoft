vi THE ADELPHOE.

> Demea, who has heard about Aeschinus' abduction of
the music-girl, attributes the real blame for his mis-
conduct to Micio, who had been too lax in his train-
ing. Sostrata als0, who had learned of Aeschinus'
conduct, and not knowing the reason for it, thinks
that her daughter has been deserted, and sends HegiO, ³

an old family friend, to care for their interests. .

Demea not long after becomes very indignant, when he ,

hears that his son Ctesipho also has been interested
in the kidnapping of the gir13 but his anger is turned
to joy when the slave Syrus informs him that Ctesi-
pho visited Aeschinus merely to rebuke him, and then
went home. After he has been told by Hegio that
Aeschinus had treated Pamphila in a shameless man-
ner, he makes a fruitless search for Micio in the
city, and finally goes to his brother⁷s home. Micio
informs him that he has given his consent to the mar-
riage of Aeschinus and Pamphila, and urges Demea
to accept· the present condition of affairs in relation
to their sons. Demea suddenly changes his demeanor,
becoming extremely indulgent toward every one. Ctesi-
pho is permitted to have the music-gir13 Aeschinus
marries Pamphila3 Micio is persuaded to marry her ·
mother, Sostrata3 Hegio receives a farm, and Syrus
and his wife secure manumissions. The play closes
with an explanation from Demea of the change in his
manners, and some good advice to his brother and
his sons.
