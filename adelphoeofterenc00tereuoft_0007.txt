PREFAOE.

——000—-—

Tms little book has been prepared especially for
those teachers wh0, after a class has critically studied
a eomedy of either Plautus or Terence, may desire to
read rapidly a second play. The notes are intended
simply to assist in translation, and for the sake of
convenience are placed on the pages with the text.
The classical forms of archaic words are given at least
once.

It is hoped that the stage directions will serve to
make the student appreciate the fact that the play
was written, not for reading simply, but to be acted
on the stage. The text is taken from the 1884 edi-
tion of Carolus Dziatzko, with a few deviations.

I am under great obligations to Professor E. M.
Pease, the editor-in-chief of the series, for his valuable
criticism and numerous helpful suggestions, also to
Professor Grove E. Barber of the University of Ne-
braska, and to Professor L. H. Elwell, who have care-

fully read the whole proof.
